Rules for including examples in the RSGHB package
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Examples should be placed in their own folder in the "Examples" folder
2. Examples must be self containing and "source-able"
	- This means that any supplementary data to run the example should be included in the folder with the example R script
	- Also means that the example R script should run entirely without additional user input
3. An object called "model" containing the resulting model object should be saved as modelname.RData
